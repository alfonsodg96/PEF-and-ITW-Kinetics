# PEF-and-ITW-Kinetics Rationale

A kinetic comparison between hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP; PEF in spanish) and idiopathic toe walking (ITW), is proposed in this study. Both are neurological disorders with motor impairments that affect normal walk. HSP is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive spasticity, muscle weakness and reduced propioception in lower extremities caused by an axonal degeneration of the corticospinal tracts and posterior spinal columns mainly. ITW is currently defined as a pathological gait pattern of the tip of the toes, with an absence or limitation of heel strike during the initial contact of the gait cycle. Neurological causes heve been ruled out as the reason for this disorder, however suggesting a sensory processing dysfunction. After performing an instrumented gait analysis to PEF and ITW patients, kinematic, kinetic and spatiotemporal parameters were obtained and quantified.

A kinetic comparison could provide some insights of both disorders and could help in their differentiation and
early diagnosis, based on motor features.
