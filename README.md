# PEF-and-ITW-Kinetics

A kinetic comparison between hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP; PEF in spanish) and idiopathic toe walking (ITW),
both neurological disorders with motor impairments that affect how they walk. After performing a gait analysis,
kinematic, kinetic and spatiotemporal parameters from these patients were obtained and quantified.

A kinetic comparison could provide some insights of both disorders and could help in their differentiation and
early diagnosis.
